## House Price Predictions
Different variables come into play in appraising a house, such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, location, and much more. So, our task here is to build a machine learning model to make reasonably accurate predictions in terms of pricing houses. It would be an opportunity for those in real estate to gain more visibility on the market as a whole. In doing so, this notebook will offer a user-friendly explanation through every step using LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) principles.
