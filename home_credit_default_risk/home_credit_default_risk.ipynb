    "## Credit Default Risk\n",
    "Many of us often resort to bank loans in buying a home, given the ballooning house prices in current times. Unfortunately, many others struggle to approve loans due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories. Home Credit is trying to remedy being more inclusive of this demographic; however, it does not come without risks. Our task here would be to leverage statistical methods and machine learning techniques to ensure that the loan-approved clients can repay accordingly. So, this notebook will offer a user-friendly explanation through every step using LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) principles.\n",
